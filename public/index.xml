      <description>Causeweb.org has a great collection of statistical statements, funny songs, and jokes. My favorite was from Paul Rudnick in a play on Hal Varian’s quote
…statisticians are the new sexy vampires, only even more pasty.
I spent part of today going through them to see what I could use for classes in the future. I wish there was a way to sort them by most downloaded or votes as there are quite a few items in the collection.</description>

      <description>I remember as a kid hearing the word engineer being tacked on the end of every job. I remember a few kids joking about the garbageman being called a sanitation engineer. Coming from a National Lab I felt the pressure to call myself a scientist and sometimes wondered why I didn’t get to wear cool glasses. However, calling myself a statistical scientist felt a little weird. Towards the end of my employment at PNNL the phrase data scientist started to take off.</description>
