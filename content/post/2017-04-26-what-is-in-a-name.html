<p>I remember as a kid hearing the word <strong>engineer</strong> being tacked on the end of every job. I remember a few kids joking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_collector" target="blank">garbageman</a> being called a <strong>sanitation engineer</strong>. Coming from a <a href="http://www.pnnl.gov/" target="blank">National Lab</a> I felt the pressure to call myself a scientist and sometimes wondered why I didnâ€™t get to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pnnl/4295283153/" target="blank">wear cool glasses</a>. However, calling myself a statistical scientist felt a little weird. Towards the end of my employment at PNNL the phrase <strong>data scientist</strong> started to take off. I liked the title as I felt it communicated a little better to others my work (although I saw it used rather loosely by quite a few people).</p>
<p>Ever since I finished my graduate degree in statistics, I have tried to come up with different names to describe what I do. I am sure others have done this as well as very few people have experience with statisticians and their profession. I thought it might be fun to list some of them. I may even post about some of the names as I think the names highlight the different skills a data scientists needs.</p>
