[Causeweb.org](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/resources/fun/){target="blank"} has a great collection of statistical statements, funny songs, and jokes. My favorite was from Paul Rudnick in a play on Hal Varian's quote

> ...statisticians are the new sexy vampires, only even more pasty. 

I spent part of today going through them to see what I could use for classes in the future.  I wish there was a way to sort them by most downloaded or votes as there are quite a few items in the collection.  I petered out by the end.
